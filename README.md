# Chatbot-Project
I decided to follow along a chatbot project video series made by Python Engineer on YouTube. This project opened my mind up to the many projects and applications that are available with NLP. Here is the YouTube link for the tutorial if you wish to make your own Chat Bot https://youtu.be/RpWeNzfSUHw .

Packages Needed: torch, nltk, json


1. To run chat bot, you need to first run train.py with the information you want to train the bot with first. This information is in the intents.json file.
2. After train.py has been run, it will create a file called data.pth, you can now run chat.py to start chatting with the bot in the terminal.
